Version 2.04 March 21, 2017 
  Typo in IRLibSAMD21.h
Version 2.03 March 17, 2017 
  Removed restrictions on Adafruit Feather 32u4 pin 9 
Version 2.02 March 15, 2017 
  Expanded support for SAMD 21. Now can use any available PWM
    pins for output. TCC0 and TCC1 selected automatically based
    on pin number. Receiving using 50 microsecond interrupt defaults
    to using TC3 however TC4 and TC5 can be used optionally to avoid
    conflicts with other libraries. GCLK0 is used for both sending and
    receiving however it uses the default 48 MHz clock source without
    any divisor so it's safe to use despite the fact it's normally 
    reserved for internal Arduino infrastructure.
Version 2.01 February 28, 2017
  Added preliminary support for SAMD 21 platforms such as
    Arduino Zero, Arduino M0 Pro, and Adafruit Feather M0.
  Note: Documentation has not yet been updated to support SAMD 21.
    See IRLib2/SAMD21.txt for details.

Version beta 0.11 September 21, 2016
  Fixed extra character in IRLibProtocols/IRLibCombo.h

Additional release beta version 0.1 September 20, 2016
  Major rewrite of IRLib1 restructuring everything
  Added auto resume feature when using external buffer
  But fixes
  Included new protocols which were previously supported only
    by sample code into the main libraries.
  See users manual Appendix A for details of changes and explanation
    of reasons that this is no longer backward-compatible with IRLib1.
  Added Section 2 Beginners Tutorial and long-awaited Section 3 on
    how to add new protocols.
